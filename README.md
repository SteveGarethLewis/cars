# Cars

I have split my commits up to give you an idea of my workflow, although they could probably be smaller still.

### Project Technologies
- I have used Vue CLI to set up a basic Vue App as it is really quick to get up and running.
- Vue Router to handle to the routing.
- TailwindCSS for styling as it's really quick to create a nice looking UI.
- Axios to handle the HTTP requests, it's a package I have used a lot and I love their API.
- Jest, Expect & Vue Test Utils for testing, again, it's my go-to for frontend testing.

### Project setup
Clone the repo then run
```
yarn install
```
```
yarn serve
```
